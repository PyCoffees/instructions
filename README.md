# General instructions for the PyCoffees @ CAB

### Goals 
Meet for 30 minutes (maximum) on alternate Wednesdays (every two weeks) from 10:30-11:00 in the Villafranca library so that one of us can share and explain in a Jupyter Notebook any python trick that they may have learned or that seemed useful to him/her. The explanation itself should not last more than 10-15 minutes to be enjoyable.

### Topics
You can access the Spreadsheet circulated (see internal emails)

### Calendar
